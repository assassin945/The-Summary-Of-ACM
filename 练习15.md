## 1001-Prime Ring Problem

### Problem Description

A ring is compose of n circles as shown in diagram. Put natural number 1, 2, ..., n into each circle separately, and the sum of numbers in two adjacent circles should be a prime.

Note: the number of first circle should always be 1.

### Input

n (0 < n < 20).

### Output

The output format is shown as sample below. Each row represents a series of circle numbers in the ring beginning from 1 clockwisely and anticlockwisely. The order of numbers must satisfy the above requirements. Print solutions in lexicographical order.

You are to write a program that completes above process.

Print a blank line after each case.

### Sample Input

```
6
8
```

### Sample Output

```
Case 1:
1 4 3 2 5 6
1 6 5 2 3 4

Case 2:
1 2 3 8 5 6 7 4
1 2 5 8 3 4 7 6
1 4 7 6 5 8 3 2
1 6 7 4 3 8 5 2
```

## 1002-How many prime numbers

### Problem Description

  Give you a lot of positive integers, just to find out how many prime numbers there are.

### Input

  There are a lot of cases. In each case, there is an integer N representing the number of integers to find. Each integer won’t exceed 32-bit signed integer, and each of them won’t be less than 2.

### Output

  For each case, print the number of prime numbers you have found out.

### Sample Input

```
3
2 3 4
```

### Sample Output

```
2
```

## 1003-Square

### Problem Description

Given a set of sticks of various lengths, is it possible to join them end-to-end to form a square?

### Input

The first line of input contains N, the number of test cases. Each test case begins with an integer 4 <= M <= 20, the number of sticks. M integers follow; each gives the length of a stick - an integer between 1 and 10,000.

### Output

For each case, output a line containing "yes" if is is possible to form a square; otherwise output "no".

### Sample Input

```
3
4 1 1 1 1
5 10 20 30 40 50
8 1 7 2 6 4 4 3 5
```

### Sample Output

```
yes
no
yes
```

## 1004-DNA sequence

### Problem Description

The twenty-first century is a biology-technology developing century. We know that a gene is made of DNA. The nucleotide bases from which DNA is built are A(adenine), C(cytosine), G(guanine), and T(thymine). Finding the longest common subsequence between DNA/Protein sequences is one of the basic problems in modern computational molecular biology. But this problem is a little different. Given several DNA sequences, you are asked to make a shortest sequence from them so that each of the given sequence is the subsequence of it.

For example, given "ACGT","ATGC","CGTT" and "CAGT", you can make a sequence in the following way. It is the shortest but may be not the only one.

### Input

The first line is the test case number t. Then t test cases follow. In each case, the first line is an integer n ( 1<=n<=8 ) represents number of the DNA sequences. The following k lines contain the k sequences, one per line. Assuming that the length of any sequence is between 1 and 5.

### Output

For each test case, print a line containing the length of the shortest sequence that can be made from these sequences.

### Sample Input

```
1
4
ACGT
ATGC
CGTT
CAGT
```

### Sample Output

```
8
```
