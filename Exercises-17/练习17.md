## 1001-Tempter of the Bone

### Problem Description

The doggie found a bone in an ancient maze, which fascinated him a lot. However, when he picked it up, the maze began to shake, and the doggie could feel the ground sinking. He realized that the bone was a trap, and he tried desperately to get out of this maze.

The maze was a rectangle with sizes N by M. There was a door in the maze. At the beginning, the door was closed and it would open at the T-th second for a short period of time (less than 1 second). Therefore the doggie had to arrive at the door on exactly the T-th second. In every second, he could move one block to one of the upper, lower, left and right neighboring blocks. Once he entered a block, the ground of this block would start to sink and disappear in the next second. He could not stay at one block for more than one second, nor could he move into a visited block. Can the poor doggie survive? Please help him.

### Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers N, M, and T (1 < N, M < 7; 0 < T < 50), which denote the sizes of the maze and the time at which the door will open, respectively. The next N lines give the maze layout, with each line containing M characters. A character is one of the following:

'X': a block of wall, which the doggie cannot enter; 
'S': the start point of the doggie; 
'D': the Door; or
'.': an empty block.

The input is terminated with three 0's. This test case is not to be processed.

### Output

For each test case, print in one line "YES" if the doggie can survive, or "NO" otherwise.

### Sample Input

```

## 1002-Cake

### Problem Description

There are m soda and today is their birthday. The 1-st soda has prepared n cakes with size 1,2,…,n. Now 1-st soda wants to divide the cakes into m parts so that the total size of each part is equal. 

Note that you cannot divide a whole cake into small pieces that is each cake must be complete in the m parts. Each cake must belong to exact one of m parts.

### Input

There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer T, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:

The first contains two integers n and m (1≤n≤105,2≤m≤10), the number of cakes and the number of soda.
It is guaranteed that the total number of soda in the input doesn’t exceed 1000000. The number of test cases in the input doesn’t exceed 1000.

### Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without the quotes) if it is possible, otherwise output "NO" in the first line.

If it is possible, then output m lines denoting the m parts. The first number si of i-th line is the number of cakes in i-th part. Then sinumbers follow denoting the size of cakes in i-th part. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

### Sample Input

```

1 2
5 3
5 2
9 3
```

### Sample Output

```
NO
YES
1 5
2 1 4

## 1003-Lights Against Dudely

### Problem Description

Harry: "But Hagrid. How am I going to pay for all of this? I haven't any money." 
Hagrid: "Well there's your money, Harry! Gringotts, the wizard bank! Ain't no safer place. Not one. Except perhaps Hogwarts." 
— Rubeus Hagrid to Harry Potter. 
  Gringotts Wizarding Bank is the only bank of the wizarding world, and is owned and operated by goblins. It was created by a goblin called Gringott. Its main offices are located in the North Side of Diagon Alley in London, England. In addition to storing money and valuables for wizards and witches, one can go there to exchange Muggle money for wizarding money. The currency exchanged by Muggles is later returned to circulation in the Muggle world by goblins. According to Rubeus Hagrid, other than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Gringotts is the safest place in the wizarding world.
  The text above is quoted from Harry Potter Wiki. But now Gringotts Wizarding Bank is not safe anymore. The stupid Dudley, Harry Potter's cousin, just robbed the bank. Of course, uncle Vernon, the drill seller, is behind the curtain because he has the most advanced drills in the world. Dudley drove an invisible and soundless drilling machine into the bank, and stole all Harry Potter's wizarding money and Muggle money. Dumbledore couldn't stand with it. He ordered to put some magic lights in the bank rooms to detect Dudley's drilling machine. The bank can be considered as a N × M grid consisting of N × M rooms. Each room has a coordinate. The coordinates of the upper-left room is (1,1) , the down-right room is (N,M) and the room below the upper-left room is (2,1)..... A 3×4 bank grid is shown below:
![img](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/C486-1001-1.jpg)
　　Some rooms are indestructible and some rooms are vulnerable. Dudely's machine can only pass the vulnerable rooms. So lights must be put to light up all vulnerable rooms. There are at most fifteen vulnerable rooms in the bank. You can at most put one light in one room. The light of the lights can penetrate the walls. If you put a light in room (x,y), it lights up three rooms: room (x,y), room (x-1,y) and room (x,y+1). Dumbledore has only one special light whose lighting direction can be turned by 0 degree,90 degrees, 180 degrees or 270 degrees. For example, if the special light is put in room (x,y) and its lighting direction is turned by 90 degrees, it will light up room (x,y), room (x,y+1 ) and room (x+1,y). Now please help Dumbledore to figure out at least how many lights he has to use to light up all vulnerable rooms.
　　Please pay attention that you can't light up any indestructible rooms, because the goblins there hate light. 



### Input

　　There are several test cases.
　　In each test case:
　　The first line are two integers N and M, meaning that the bank is a N × M grid(0<N,M <= 200).
　　Then a N×M matrix follows. Each element is a letter standing for a room. '#' means a indestructible room, and '.' means a vulnerable room. 
　　The input ends with N = 0 and M = 0

### Output

　　For each test case, print the minimum number of lights which Dumbledore needs to put.
　　If there are no vulnerable rooms, print 0.
　　If Dumbledore has no way to light up all vulnerable rooms, print -1.

## 1004-Black And White

### Problem Description

In mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.
— Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In this problem, you have to solve the 4-color problem. Hey, I’m just joking.

You are asked to solve a similar problem:

Color an N × M chessboard with K colors numbered from 1 to K such that no two adjacent cells have the same color (two cells are adjacent if they share an edge). The i-th color should be used in exactly ci cells.

Matt hopes you can tell him a possible coloring.

### Input

The first line contains only one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 5000), which indicates the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains three integers: N, M, K (0 < N, M ≤ 5, 0 < K ≤ N × M ).

The second line contains K integers ci (ci > 0), denoting the number of cells where the i-th color should be used.

It’s guaranteed that c1 + c2 + · · · + cK = N × M .

### Output

For each test case, the first line contains “Case #x:”, where x is the case number (starting from 1). 

In the second line, output “NO” if there is no coloring satisfying the requirements. Otherwise, output “YES” in one line. Each of the following N lines contains M numbers seperated by single whitespace, denoting the color of the cells.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

### Sample Input

```

4 1
3 3 4
1 2 2 4
2 3 3

Case #2:

Case #3:
