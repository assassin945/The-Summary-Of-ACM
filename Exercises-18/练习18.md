## 1001-How Many Tables

### Problem Description

Today is Ignatius' birthday. He invites a lot of friends. Now it's dinner time. Ignatius wants to know how many tables he needs at least. You have to notice that not all the friends know each other, and all the friends do not want to stay with strangers.

One important rule for this problem is that if I tell you A knows B, and B knows C, that means A, B, C know each other, so they can stay in one table.

For example: If I tell you A knows B, B knows C, and D knows E, so A, B, C can stay in one table, and D, E have to stay in the other one. So Ignatius needs 2 tables at least.

### Input

The input starts with an integer T(1<=T<=25) which indicate the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case starts with two integers N and M(1<=N,M<=1000). N indicates the number of friends, the friends are marked from 1 to N. Then M lines follow. Each line consists of two integers A and B(A!=B), that means friend A and friend B know each other. There will be a blank line between two cases.

### Output

For each test case, just output how many tables Ignatius needs at least. Do NOT print any blanks.

### Sample Input

```
2
5 3
1 2
2 3
4 5

5 1
2 5
```

### Sample Output

```
2
4
```

## 1002-畅通工程

### Problem Description

某省调查城镇交通状况，得到现有城镇道路统计表，表中列出了每条道路直接连通的城镇。省政府“畅通工程”的目标是使全省任何两个城镇间都可以实现交通（但不一定有直接的道路相连，只要互相间接通过道路可达即可）。问最少还需要建设多少条道路？ 

### Input

测试输入包含若干测试用例。每个测试用例的第1行给出两个正整数，分别是城镇数目N ( < 1000 )和道路数目M；随后的M行对应M条道路，每行给出一对正整数，分别是该条道路直接连通的两个城镇的编号。为简单起见，城镇从1到N编号。 
注意:两个城市之间可以有多条道路相通,也就是说
3 3
1 2
1 2
2 1
这种输入也是合法的
当N为0时，输入结束，该用例不被处理。 

### Output

对每个测试用例，在1行里输出最少还需要建设的道路数目。 

### Sample Input

```
4 2
1 3
4 3
3 3
1 2
1 3
2 3
5 2
1 2
3 5
999 0
0
```

### Sample Output

```
1
0
2
998
```

### Hint

Hint
Huge input, scanf is recommended.

## 1003-More is better

### Problem Description

Mr Wang wants some boys to help him with a project. Because the project is rather complex, **the more boys come, the better it will be**. Of course there are certain requirements.

Mr Wang selected a room big enough to hold the boys. The boy who are not been chosen has to leave the room immediately. There are 10000000 boys in the room numbered from 1 to 10000000 at the very beginning. After Mr Wang's selection any two of them who are still in this room should be friends (direct or indirect), or there is only one boy left. Given all the direct friend-pairs, you should decide the best way.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) - the number of direct friend-pairs. The following n lines each contains a pair of numbers A and B separated by a single space that suggests A and B are direct friends. (A ≠ B, 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10000000)

### Output

The output in one line contains exactly one integer equals to the maximum number of boys Mr Wang may keep. 

### Sample Input

```
4
1 2
3 4
5 6
1 6
4
1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
```

### Sample Output

```
4
2
```

### Hint

A and B are friends(direct or indirect), B and C are friends(direct or indirect), 
then A and C are also friends(indirect).

In the first sample {1,2,5,6} is the result.
In the second sample {1,2},{3,4},{5,6},{7,8} are four kinds of answers.

## 1004-Farm Irrigation

### Problem Description

Benny has a spacious farm land to irrigate. The farm land is a rectangle, and is divided into a lot of samll squares. Water pipes are placed in these squares. Different square has a different type of pipe. There are 11 types of pipes, which is marked from A to K, as Figure 1 shows.

![img](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/1121-1.gif)
Figure 1

Benny has a map of his farm, which is an array of marks denoting the distribution of water pipes over the whole farm. For example, if he has a map 

ADC
FJK
IHE

then the water pipes are distributed like 

![img](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/1121-2.gif)
Figure 2

Several wellsprings are found in the center of some squares, so water can flow along the pipes from one square to another. If water flow crosses one square, the whole farm land in this square is irrigated and will have a good harvest in autumn. 

Now Benny wants to know at least how many wellsprings should be found to have the whole farm land irrigated. Can you help him? 

Note: In the above example, at least 3 wellsprings are needed, as those red points in Figure 2 show.

### Input

There are several test cases! In each test case, the first line contains 2 integers M and N, then M lines follow. In each of these lines, there are N characters, in the range of 'A' to 'K', denoting the type of water pipe over the corresponding square. A negative M or N denotes the end of input, else you can assume 1 <= M, N <= 50.

### Output

For each test case, output in one line the least number of wellsprings needed.

### Sample Input

```
2 2
DK
HF

3 3
ADC
FJK
IHE

-1 -1
```

### Sample Output

```
2
3
```
