## 1001-N皇后问题

### Problem Description

在N*N的方格棋盘放置了N个皇后，使得它们不相互攻击（即任意2个皇后不允许处在同一排，同一列，也不允许处在与棋盘边框成45角的斜线上。
你的任务是，对于给定的N，求出有多少种合法的放置方法。



### Input

共有若干行，每行一个正整数N≤10，表示棋盘和皇后的数量；如果N=0，表示结束。

### Output

共有若干行，每行一个正整数，表示对应输入行的皇后的不同放置数量。

### Sample Input

```
1
8
5
0
```

### Sample Output

```
1
92
10
```

## 1002-Safe cracker

### Problem Description

=== Op tech briefing, 2002/11/02 06:42 CST === 
"The item is locked in a Klein safe behind a painting in the second-floor library. Klein safes are extremely rare; most of them, along with Klein and his factory, were destroyed in World War II. Fortunately old Brumbaugh from research knew Klein's secrets and wrote them down before he died. A Klein safe has two distinguishing features: a combination lock that uses letters instead of numbers, and an engraved quotation on the door. A Klein quotation always contains between five and twelve distinct uppercase letters, usually at the beginning of sentences, and mentions one or more numbers. Five of the uppercase letters form the combination that opens the safe. By combining the digits from all the numbers in the appropriate way you get a numeric target. (The details of constructing the target number are classified.) To find the combination you must select five letters v, w, x, y, and z that satisfy the following equation, where each letter is replaced by its ordinal position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). The combination is then vwxyz. If there is more than one solution then the combination is the one that is lexicographically greatest, i.e., the one that would appear last in a dictionary." 

v - w^2 + x^3 - y^4 + z^5 = target 

"For example, given target 1 and letter set ABCDEFGHIJKL, one possible solution is FIECB, since 6 - 9^2 + 5^3 - 3^4 + 2^5 = 1. There are actually several solutions in this case, and the combination turns out to be LKEBA. Klein thought it was safe to encode the combination within the engraving, because it could take months of effort to try all the possibilities even if you knew the secret. But of course computers didn't exist then." 

=== Op tech directive, computer division, 2002/11/02 12:30 CST === 

"Develop a program to find Klein combinations in preparation for field deployment. Use standard test methodology as per departmental regulations. Input consists of one or more lines containing a positive integer target less than twelve million, a space, then at least five and at most twelve distinct uppercase letters. The last line will contain a target of zero and the letters END; this signals the end of the input. For each line output the Klein combination, break ties with lexicographic order, or 'no solution' if there is no correct combination. Use the exact format shown below."

### Sample Input

```
1 ABCDEFGHIJKL
11700519 ZAYEXIWOVU
3072997 SOUGHT
1234567 THEQUICKFROG
0 END
```

### Sample Output

```
LKEBA
YOXUZ
GHOST
no solution
```

## 1003-Prime Ring Problem

### Problem Description

A ring is compose of n circles as shown in diagram. Put natural number 1, 2, ..., n into each circle separately, and the sum of numbers in two adjacent circles should be a prime.

Note: the number of first circle should always be 1.

### Input

n (0 < n < 20).

### Output

The output format is shown as sample below. Each row represents a series of circle numbers in the ring beginning from 1 clockwisely and anticlockwisely. The order of numbers must satisfy the above requirements. Print solutions in lexicographical order.

You are to write a program that completes above process.

Print a blank line after each case.

### Sample Input

```
6
8
```

### Sample Output

```
Case 1:
1 4 3 2 5 6
1 6 5 2 3 4

Case 2:
1 2 3 8 5 6 7 4
1 2 5 8 3 4 7 6
1 4 7 6 5 8 3 2
1 6 7 4 3 8 5 2
```
