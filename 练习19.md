## 1001-Virtual Friends

### Problem Description

These days, you can do all sorts of things online. For example, you can use various websites to make virtual friends. For some people, growing their social network (their friends, their friends' friends, their friends' friends' friends, and so on), has become an addictive hobby. Just as some people collect stamps, other people collect virtual friends. 

Your task is to observe the interactions on such a website and keep track of the size of each person's network. 

Assume that every friendship is mutual. If Fred is Barney's friend, then Barney is also Fred's friend.

### Input

Input file contains multiple test cases. 
The first line of each case indicates the number of test friendship nest.
each friendship nest begins with a line containing an integer F, the number of friendships formed in this frindship nest, which is no more than 100 000. Each of the following F lines contains the names of two people who have just become friends, separated by a space. A name is a string of 1 to 20 letters (uppercase or lowercase).

### Output

Whenever a friendship is formed, print a line containing one integer, the number of people in the social network of the two people who have just become friends.

### Sample Input

```
1
3
Fred Barney
Barney Betty
Betty Wilma
```

### Sample Output

```

## 1002-A Bug's Life

### Problem Description

**Background** 
Professor Hopper is researching the sexual behavior of a rare species of bugs. He assumes that they feature two different genders and that they only interact with bugs of the opposite gender. In his experiment, individual bugs and their interactions were easy to identify, because numbers were printed on their backs. 

**Problem** 
Given a list of bug interactions, decide whether the experiment supports his assumption of two genders with no homosexual bugs or if it contains some bug interactions that falsify it.

### Input

The first line of the input contains the number of scenarios. Each scenario starts with one line giving the number of bugs (at least one, and up to 2000) and the number of interactions (up to 1000000) separated by a single space. In the following lines, each interaction is given in the form of two distinct bug numbers separated by a single space. Bugs are numbered consecutively starting from one.

### Output

The output for every scenario is a line containing "Scenario #i:", where i is the number of the scenario starting at 1, followed by one line saying either "No suspicious bugs found!" if the experiment is consistent with his assumption about the bugs' sexual behavior, or "Suspicious bugs found!" if Professor Hopper's assumption is definitely wrong.

### Sample Input

```
2
3 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
4 2
1 2
3 4
```

### Sample Output

```
Scenario #1:
Suspicious bugs found!

Scenario #2:
No suspicious bugs found!
```

### Hint

Huge input,scanf is recommended.

## 1003-Zjnu Stadium

### Problem Description

In 12th Zhejiang College Students Games 2007, there was a new stadium built in Zhejiang Normal University. It was a modern stadium which could hold thousands of people. The audience Seats made a circle. The total number of columns were 300 numbered 1--300, counted clockwise, we assume the number of rows were infinite.
These days, Busoniya want to hold a large-scale theatrical performance in this stadium. There will be N people go there numbered 1--N. Busoniya has Reserved several seats. To make it funny, he makes M requests for these seats: A B X, which means people numbered B must seat clockwise X distance from people numbered A. For example: A is in column 4th and X is 2, then B must in column 6th (6=4+2).
Now your task is to judge weather the request is correct or not. The rule of your judgement is easy: when a new request has conflicts against the foregoing ones then we define it as incorrect, otherwise it is correct. Please find out all the incorrect requests and count them as R.

### Input

There are many test cases:
For every case: 
The first line has two integer N(1<=N<=50,000), M(0<=M<=100,000),separated by a space.
Then M lines follow, each line has 3 integer A(1<=A<=N), B(1<=B<=N), X(0<=X<300) (A!=B), separated by a space.



### Output

For every case: 
Output R, represents the number of incorrect request.

### Sample Input

```
10 10
1 2 150
3 4 200
1 5 270
2 6 200
6 5 80
4 7 150
8 9 100
4 8 50
1 7 100
9 2 100
```

### Sample Output

```
2
```

### Hint

Hint:
（PS： the 5th and 10th requests are incorrect）

## 1004-Building Block

### Problem Description

John are playing with blocks. There are N blocks (1 <= N <= 30000) numbered 1...N。Initially, there are N piles, and each pile contains one block. Then John do some operations P times (1 <= P <= 1000000). There are two kinds of operation:

M X Y : Put the whole pile containing block X up to the pile containing Y. If X and Y are in the same pile, just ignore this command. 
C X : Count the number of blocks under block X 

You are request to find out the output for each C operation.

### Input

The first line contains integer P. Then P lines follow, each of which contain an operation describe above.

### Output

Output the count for each C operations in one line.

### Sample Input

```
6
M 1 6
C 1
M 2 4
M 2 6
C 3
C 4
```

### Sample Output

```
1
0
2
```
