## 1001-Constructing Roads in JGSing's Kingdom

### Problem Description

JGShining's kingdom consists of 2n(n is no more than 500,000) small cities which are located in two parallel lines.

Half of these cities are rich in resource (we call them rich cities) while the others are short of resource (we call them poor cities). Each poor city is short of exactly one kind of resource and also each rich city is rich in exactly one kind of resource. You may assume no two poor cities are short of one same kind of resource and no two rich cities are rich in one same kind of resource.

With the development of industry, poor cities wanna import resource from rich ones. The roads existed are so small that they're unable to ensure the heavy trucks, so new roads should be built. The poor cities strongly BS each other, so are the rich ones. Poor cities don't wanna build a road with other poor ones, and rich ones also can't abide sharing an end of road with other rich ones. Because of economic benefit, any rich city will be willing to export resource to any poor one.

Rich citis marked from 1 to n are located in Line I and poor ones marked from 1 to n are located in Line II.

The location of Rich City 1 is on the left of all other cities, Rich City 2 is on the left of all other cities excluding Rich City 1, Rich City 3 is on the right of Rich City 1 and Rich City 2 but on the left of all other cities ... And so as the poor ones.

But as you know, two crossed roads may cause a lot of traffic accident so JGShining has established a law to forbid constructing crossed roads.

For example, the roads in Figure I are forbidden.

In order to build as many roads as possible, the young and handsome king of the kingdom - JGShining needs your help, please help him. ^_^

### Input

Each test case will begin with a line containing an integer n(1 ≤ n ≤ 500,000). Then n lines follow. Each line contains two integers p and r which represents that Poor City p needs to import resources from Rich City r. Process to the end of file.

### Output

For each test case, output the result in the form of sample.
You should tell JGShining what's the maximal number of road(s) can be built.

### Sample Input

```
2
1 2
2 1
3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```

### Sample Output

```
Case 1:
My king, at most 1 road can be built.

Case 2:
My king, at most 2 roads can be built.
```

### Hint

Huge input, scanf is recommended.

## 1002-Monkey and Banana

### Problem Description

A group of researchers are designing an experiment to test the IQ of a monkey. They will hang a banana at the roof of a building, and at the mean time, provide the monkey with some blocks. If the monkey is clever enough, it shall be able to reach the banana by placing one block on the top another to build a tower and climb up to get its favorite food.

The researchers have n types of blocks, and an unlimited supply of blocks of each type. Each type-i block was a rectangular solid with linear dimensions (xi, yi, zi). A block could be reoriented so that any two of its three dimensions determined the dimensions of the base and the other dimension was the height.

They want to make sure that the tallest tower possible by stacking blocks can reach the roof. The problem is that, in building a tower, one block could only be placed on top of another block as long as the two base dimensions of the upper block were both strictly smaller than the corresponding base dimensions of the lower block because there has to be some space for the monkey to step on. This meant, for example, that blocks oriented to have equal-sized bases couldn't be stacked.

Your job is to write a program that determines the height of the tallest tower the monkey can build with a given set of blocks.

### Input

The input file will contain one or more test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n,
representing the number of different blocks in the following data set. The maximum value for n is 30.
Each of the next n lines contains three integers representing the values xi, yi and zi.
Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for n.

### Output

For each test case, print one line containing the case number (they are numbered sequentially starting from 1) and the height of the tallest possible tower in the format "Case case: maximum height = height".

### Sample Input

```
1
10 20 30
2
6 8 10
5 5 5
7
1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3

5 5 5
6 6 6
7 7 7

31 41 59
26 53 58
97 93 23
84 62 64
33 83 27
0
```

### Sample Output

```
Case 1: maximum height = 40
Case 2: maximum height = 21
Case 3: maximum height = 28
Case 4: maximum height = 342

## 1003-Common Subsequence

### Problem Description

A subsequence of a given sequence is the given sequence with some elements (possible none) left out. Given a sequence X = <x1, x2, ..., xm> another sequence Z = <z1, z2, ..., zk> is a subsequence of X if there exists a strictly increasing sequence <i1, i2, ..., ik> of indices of X such that for all j = 1,2,...,k, xij = zj. For example, Z = <a, b, f, c> is a subsequence of X = <a, b, c, f, b, c> with index sequence <1, 2, 4, 6>. Given two sequences X and Y the problem is to find the length of the maximum-length common subsequence of X and Y.
The program input is from a text file. Each data set in the file contains two strings representing the given sequences. The sequences are separated by any number of white spaces. The input data are correct. For each set of data the program prints on the standard output the length of the maximum-length common subsequence from the beginning of a separate line.

### Sample Input

## 1004-FatMouse's Speed

### Problem Description

FatMouse believes that the fatter a mouse is, the faster it runs. To disprove this, you want to take the data on a collection of mice and put as large a subset of this data as possible into a sequence so that the weights are increasing, but the speeds are decreasing.

### Input

Input contains data for a bunch of mice, one mouse per line, terminated by end of file.

The data for a particular mouse will consist of a pair of integers: the first representing its size in grams and the second representing its speed in centimeters per second. Both integers are between 1 and 10000. The data in each test case will contain information for at most 1000 mice.

Two mice may have the same weight, the same speed, or even the same weight and speed.

### Output

Your program should output a sequence of lines of data; the first line should contain a number n; the remaining n lines should each contain a single positive integer (each one representing a mouse). If these n integers are m[1], m[2],..., m[n] then it must be the case that

W[m[1]] < W[m[2]] < ... < W[m[n]]

and

S[m[1]] > S[m[2]] > ... > S[m[n]]

In order for the answer to be correct, n should be as large as possible.
All inequalities are strict: weights must be strictly increasing, and speeds must be strictly decreasing. There may be many correct outputs for a given input, your program only needs to find one.

### Sample Input

```
6008 1300
6000 2100
500 2000
1000 4000
1100 3000
6000 2000
8000 1400
6000 1200
2000 1900

## 1006-Super Jumping! Jumping! Jumping!

### Problem Description

Nowadays, a kind of chess game called “Super Jumping! Jumping! Jumping!” is very popular in HDU. Maybe you are a good boy, and know little about this game, so I introduce it to you now.

![img](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/1087-1.jpg)

The game can be played by two or more than two players. It consists of a chessboard（棋盘）and some chessmen（棋子）, and all chessmen are marked by a positive integer or “start” or “end”. The player starts from start-point and must jumps into end-point finally. In the course of jumping, the player will visit the chessmen in the path, but everyone must jumps from one chessman to another absolutely bigger (you can assume start-point is a minimum and end-point is a maximum.). And all players cannot go backwards. One jumping can go from a chessman to next, also can go across many chessmen, and even you can straightly get to end-point from start-point. Of course you get zero point in this situation. A player is a winner if and only if he can get a bigger score according to his jumping solution. Note that your score comes from the sum of value on the chessmen in you jumping path.
Your task is to output the maximum value according to the given chessmen list.

### Input

Input contains multiple test cases. Each test case is described in a line as follow:
N value_1 value_2 …value_N
It is guarantied that N is not more than 1000 and all value_i are in the range of 32-int.
A test case starting with 0 terminates the input and this test case is not to be processed.

### Output

For each case, print the maximum according to rules, and one line one case.

### Sample Input

```
3 1 3 2
4 1 2 3 4
4 3 3 2 1
0
```

### Sample Output

```

## 1007-array array array

### Problem Description

One day, Kaitou Kiddo had stolen a priceless diamond ring. But detective Conan blocked Kiddo's path to escape from the museum. But Kiddo didn't want to give it back. So, Kiddo asked Conan a question. If Conan could give a right answer, Kiddo would return the ring to the museum.
Kiddo: "I have an array A and a number k, if you can choose exactly k elements from A and erase them, then the remaining array is in non-increasing order or non-decreasing order, we say A is a magic array. Now I want you to tell me whether A is a magic array. " Conan: "emmmmm..." Now, Conan seems to be in trouble, can you help him?

### Input

The first line contains an integer T indicating the total number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k in one line, then one line with n integers: A1,A2…An.
1≤T≤20
1≤n≤105
0≤k≤n
1≤Ai≤105

### Output

For each test case, please output "A is a magic array." if it is a magic array. Otherwise, output "A is not a magic array." (without quotes).

### Sample Input

```
3
4 1
1 4 3 7
5 2
4 1 3 1 2
6 1
1 4 3 5 4 6
```

### Sample Output

```
A is a magic array.
A is a magic array.
A is not a magic array.

## 1008-Advanced Fruits

### Problem Description

The company "21st Century Fruits" has specialized in creating new sorts of fruits by transferring genes from one fruit into the genome of another one. Most times this method doesn't work, but sometimes, in very rare cases, a new fruit emerges that tastes like a mixture between both of them.
A big topic of discussion inside the company is "How should the new creations be called?" A mixture between an apple and a pear could be called an apple-pear, of course, but this doesn't sound very interesting. The boss finally decides to use the shortest string that contains both names of the original fruits as sub-strings as the new name. For instance, "applear" contains "apple" and "pear" (APPLEar and apPlEAR), and there is no shorter string that has the same property.

A combination of a cranberry and a boysenberry would therefore be called a "boysecranberry" or a "craboysenberry", for example.

Your job is to write a program that computes such a shortest name for a combination of two given fruits. Your algorithm should be efficient, otherwise it is unlikely that it will execute in the alloted time for long fruit names.

### Input

Each line of the input contains two strings that represent the names of the fruits that should be combined. All names have a maximum length of 100 and only consist of alphabetic characters.

Input is terminated by end of file.

### Output

For each test case, output the shortest name of the resulting fruit on one line. If more than one shortest name is possible, any one is acceptable.

### Sample Input

```
apple peach
ananas banana
pear peach
```

### Sample Output

```
appleach
bananas
pearch
```
